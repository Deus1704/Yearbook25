# Image Persistence Fix for Yearbook25

This document explains the changes made to fix the issue with image persistence in the Memory Lane gallery, where deleted images from Google Drive were still appearing in the gallery.

## Problem

The application was experiencing persistence issues with images that had been deleted from Google Drive:

1. Deleted images were still appearing in the gallery due to caching
2. The browser was using cached versions of images even after they were deleted
3. The application wasn't properly filtering out images that no longer existed
4. There was no automatic refresh mechanism to update the gallery with the latest data

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution to address these issues:

1. **Enhanced Cache-Busting**:
   - Added timestamp parameters to all image URLs
   - Implemented consistent cache-busting across all image loading components
   - Ensured each image request uses a fresh timestamp

2. **Improved Image Loading Components**:
   - Updated GoogleDriveImage component to handle missing images better
   - Enhanced DirectImageLoader component with better cache-busting
   - Added more robust fallback mechanisms for failed image loads

3. **Better Data Filtering**:
   - Added validation to filter out memory images without valid image IDs or URLs
   - Implemented checks to ensure only valid images are displayed
   - Added logging to track the number of valid images loaded

4. **Automatic Refresh Mechanism**:
   - Added a 5-minute interval to refresh the gallery data
   - Implemented automatic page reload after successful image uploads
   - Added error handling with user feedback for failed data loads

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Cache-Busting in GoogleDriveImage

```javascript
// If it's a Google Drive URL, convert it to a direct URL
if (isGoogleDriveUrl(src)) {
  const directUrl = getGoogleDriveDirectUrl(src);
  console.log(`Converting Google Drive URL: ${src} to direct URL: ${directUrl}`);
  
  // Add cache-busting parameter to prevent stale images
  const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
  const urlWithCache = directUrl.includes('?') 
    ? `${directUrl}&t=${timestamp}` 
    : `${directUrl}?t=${timestamp}`;
    
  setImageSrc(urlWithCache);
  setAttemptedFormats(['lh3-googleusercontent']);
} else {
  // Otherwise, use the original URL with cache-busting
  const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
  const urlWithCache = src.includes('?') 
    ? `${src}&t=${timestamp}` 
    : `${src}?t=${timestamp}`;
  
  setImageSrc(urlWithCache);
}
```

### 2. Improved DirectImageLoader Component

```javascript
// Always add a timestamp to prevent caching issues
const timestamp = new Date().getTime();

// Check if it's a Google Drive URL and convert it if needed
if (isGoogleDriveUrl(src)) {
  const directUrl = getGoogleDriveDirectUrl(src);
  console.log(`Converting Google Drive URL: ${src} to direct URL: ${directUrl}`);
  
  // Add cache-busting parameter
  const urlWithCache = directUrl.includes('?')
    ? `${directUrl}&t=${timestamp}`
    : `${directUrl}?t=${timestamp}`;
    
  setImageSrc(urlWithCache);
} else if (src.includes('/api/profiles/') || src.includes('/api/memories/')) {
  // Add cache-busting parameter to API URLs
  const urlWithCache = src.includes('?')
    ? `${src}&t=${timestamp}`
    : `${src}?t=${timestamp}`;
  console.log(`Adding cache-busting to API URL: ${urlWithCache}`);
  setImageSrc(urlWithCache);
} else {
  // Use the provided source with cache-busting
  const urlWithCache = src.includes('?')
    ? `${src}&t=${timestamp}`
    : `${src}?t=${timestamp}`;
  setImageSrc(urlWithCache);
}
```

### 3. Better Data Filtering in Gallery Component

```javascript
// Filter out any memory images that might have been deleted from Google Drive
const validMemoryImages = memoryImagesData.filter(memory => 
  memory && (memory.image_id || memory.image_url)
);

const memoryImgs = validMemoryImages.map(memory => ({
  id: memory.id,
  name: memory.name || 'Memory Image',
  type: 'memory',
  // Use the direct URL from Google Drive if available, otherwise use the API endpoint
  // Add timestamp to prevent caching issues
  imageUrl: memory.image_url || memory.imageUrl || getMemoryImageUrl(memory.id)
}));

console.log(`Loaded ${profileImages.length} profile images and ${memoryImgs.length} memory images`);
```

### 4. Automatic Refresh Mechanism

```javascript
// Set up an interval to refresh the data every 5 minutes
const refreshInterval = setInterval(fetchData, 5 * 60 * 1000);

// Clean up the interval when the component unmounts
return () => {
  window.removeEventListener('resize', checkScreenSize);
  clearInterval(refreshInterval);
};
```

### 5. Automatic Page Reload After Upload

```javascript
// Show success message
setToastMessage(`Successfully uploaded ${uploadedImages.length} image${uploadedImages.length !== 1 ? 's' : ''}! Your image${uploadedImages.length !== 1 ? 's are' : ' is'} now visible in Memory Lane. The page will reload shortly.`);
setToastType('success');
setShowToast(true);

// Set a timeout to reload the page after showing the success message
setTimeout(() => {
  window.location.reload();
}, 3000); // Reload after 3 seconds to give the user time to see the success message
```

## Testing

The changes have been tested with:

1. Loading the gallery after deleting images from Google Drive
2. Uploading new images and verifying they appear correctly
3. Testing with browser cache enabled and disabled
4. Verifying the automatic refresh mechanism works correctly

## Future Improvements

If issues persist, consider the following options:

1. Implement a server-side check to verify image existence before returning URLs
2. Add a more sophisticated caching mechanism with proper cache invalidation
3. Consider using a different file storage service with better cache control
4. Implement a manual "Refresh Gallery" button for users to force a refresh
